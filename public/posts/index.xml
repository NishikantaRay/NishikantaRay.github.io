      <description>Micro Frontend Application
Microfrontend is an architectural approach that involves breaking down a web application into smaller, independently deployable and scalable parts. Each part, or microfrontend, is responsible for rendering a specific part of the user interface.
Benefits of microfrontend:
Improved scalability: Microfrontends allow for the application to be split into smaller, more manageable parts, making it easier to scale individual features and components as needed. Faster development cycles: Teams can work on different microfrontends simultaneously, allowing for faster development cycles and the ability to update specific features without affecting the entire application.</description>
