## ðŸŒŸ What is Study Tub?

Study Tub is the place to get overall Bachelor of Technology notes. You can also add your notes and lab materials over here. It is a website with the main idea of creating a collection of useful learning resources for students based on their feedback and request. That will allow everyone to improve their practical skills and theoretical knowledge.

### ðŸš€ðŸš€ Inspiration

Due to this covid pandemic, we're unable to have physical classes resulting in a shortage of good notes. To help my fellow mates in their studies and preparing for various exams, I came up with this idea for making this web app in such a way that it would be a key resource of knowledge whether practical or theoretical. They can find notes and help regarding any subject in B Tech.
