### **What is Dependa Bot?**

DependaBot ðŸ¤– is a GitHub application designed to simplify dependency management within repositories. It acts as a vigilant assistant, continuously monitoring dependencies and promptly notifying you about available updates. By automating this process, Dependent Bot ensures that your projects remain current and secure, sparing you the hassle of manual tracking and updating.

### **The Need for Dependency Management**

* Dependabot alertsâ€”inform you about vulnerabilities in the dependencies that you use in your repository.
    
* Dependabot security updatesâ€”automatically raise pull requests to update the dependencies you use that have known security vulnerabilities.
    
* Dependabot version updatesâ€”automatically raise pull requests to keep your dependencies up-to-date.
